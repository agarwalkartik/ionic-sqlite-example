Using sqlite with ionic framework v1

SQLite is the most powerful and commonly used persistent storage along with any android mobile app, be it a native android app or a hybrid one like ionic app.

This blog post will guide you through how to use the sqlite databse with your ionic app.

Setup

1 . Start a ionic project
    ionic start myproject --type ionic1

2. INstall sqlite-cordova plugin
    https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage
    cordova plugin add cordova-sqlite-storage --save
    Now this plugin gives you the power to talk to the native SQLite liraries of your mobile OS
    We need to enhance the power of this plugin by adding some commonly used methods in an angular factory

    createDB
    query
    fetchMany
    fetch
    getAll
    getById
    getBulkById
    add
    addBulk
    update
    deleteById
    addOrUpdate
    getByColumn
    getBulkByColum

    Now these are almost all the operations we need to perform on our db
    CHROME SUPPORT : There is no apis available in chrome browser to use sqlite db. But ionic development is often done on chrome browser also,
                      To add support for chrome browser all we need to do is add a fallback to websql if cordova sqlite plugin is not available.
                     All other methods work seemlessly on both android and chrome after this fallback is handled   



3. Now another important thing might be to pre bundle the database with your app and be able to use it when the app is being used
